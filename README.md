## OTA Update Mechanism

This app implements **Over-the-Air (OTA)** updates using **Expo's EAS Update** service. This allows for instant bug fixes and feature rollouts without requiring users to download a new version from the app store.

The update manifest, which tells the app if a new version is available, is hosted on a public **GitHub Gist**. The app fetches this manifest on launch to check for new updates and downloads them in the background.
